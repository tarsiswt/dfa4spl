in this experiment with maq-marcelo data, the analysis time for the Lampiro benchmark was set to 0 if the number of configurations of the method was 1 (meaning it has no features).

The data for the other benchmarks remain the same, but the resume for Lampiro was (re)generated and merged into the resume.xls, replacing the old data for Lampiro.

The R-script that generates statistical data had to be run again.
