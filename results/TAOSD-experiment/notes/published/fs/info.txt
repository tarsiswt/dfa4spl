These sheets are based on the ones in the files: maq-marcelo-rev-132-nofm.rar and maq-marcelo-rev-132-fm.rar, both are the results of the experiment for reviion 132, without and with the FM respectively.

The sheets are packed into the file fs.rar for publishing in the companion website.

The sheets for BerkeleyDB and Lampiro with the FM are missing because there seems to be a bug in the implementation of the FM checking.

In the root folder are the sheets without the FM. In the fm folder are the sheets with the FM.
